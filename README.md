# How to use it

After `mo_ctl` is installed, you can use `mo_ctl help` to print help info on how to use.

# Quick start
1. Take a quick look at the tool guide. 
```bash
mo_ctl help
```

2. Note that some pre-requisites are required by `mo_ctl`, and use `mo_ctl precheck` to check if your machine meets them. Refer to chapter Reference for more info on how to install them.
3. Set some configurations

```bash
mo_ctl get_conf MO_PATH # check default value of mo path to be installed
mo_ctl set_conf MO_PATH="/data/mo/20230701/matrixone" # set your own mo path
mo_ctl set_conf MO_GIT_URL="https://ghproxy.com/https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone.git" # in case have network issues, you can set this conf by overwritting default value MO_GIT_URL="https://github.com/matrixorigin/matrixone.git"
```

3. Deploy a standalone mo instance of latest stable release version(current: 0.8.0)
```bash
mo_ctl deploy
```

4. Check mo-service status
```bash
mo_ctl status
```

5. Connect to mo-service after a few seconds when mo-service's initialization is finished
```bash
mo_ctl connect
```
